# SimplestMalware
This is probably the world's simplest piece of utterly harmless but extremely annoying Python malware. It runs (with only four lines of code) an infinite loop to endlessly run the Win+Ctrl+Shift+B key combination to reset the GPU driver over and over again on a Windows PC. If you catch it immediately and hit Ctrl+Alt+Del and arrow key your way to the sign out button, you can escape it. However, if you wait a second too long and then try fighting it, it will eventually (accelerates the more you try fighting) bring your computer down tp a black screen. At least this is how it works on my MSI GP72-7RD gaming laptop, and I may post an update when I get back to college next month where I have a much more powerful desktop PC that may be able to cope with this malware a tad better than the laptop. The purpose of writing this is to demonstrate that you don't need to be some coding whiz to create some pretty annoying malware that doesn't do much more than oevrwhelm your computer and easily bring it to the point of unusability until you force a reboot (or if you catch it fast enough, a sign out).
